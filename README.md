# What is this about?
This mod for Hollow Knight adds online multiplayer through Photon Unity Networking. 

# How do I use it?
The mod is not ready for public use. If you want to help me develop it, make a new PR and we can get in touch.

### TODO
- Finish Enemy sync (need to figure out how to spawn them from resources)
- Boss sync
- Settings UI
- Maybe sync game state (map, charms, etc)
- PvP Colosseum arena
- Rebalance game for multiplayer (nail damage/enemy health)?
